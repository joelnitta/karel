\title{Generate array which shows moves that Karel can and can't make}
\usage{
generate_open_moves(nx, ny, hor_walls, ver_walls)
}
\arguments{
\item{nx, }{ny size of the world}

\item{hor_walls, }{ver_walls dataset of horizontal and vertical walls as
described in the details for the function \code{\link{generar_mundo}}.}
}
\value{
A 6nx x ny x 4 array of TRUE/FALSE values
}
\description{
This function creates \code{open_moves}, a nx x ny x 4 array of TRUE/FALSE
values indicating if Karel can move to each direction from a given position.
For example, if Karel is in the bottom left corner, which is cell [1, 1], it
can't go south or left, so we have both open_moves[1, 1, 3] and open_moves[1,
1, 4] set to FALSE. Depending on the existing walls it could move south or
north, so open_moves[1, 1, 1] and open_moves[1, 1, 2] could be TRUE or FALSE.
}
\details{
Taking into account the size of the world and the walls, this function
properly defines the array open_moves.
