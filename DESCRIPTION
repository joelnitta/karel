Description: This package implements an interactive way to teach programming 
	basics and R to students without previous knowledge on the area. By providing
	instructions to Karel The Robot to perform certain tasks, students can
	make their first steps in the world of programming in a fun environment.
	This idea of Karel The Robot was first introduced by Richard E. Pattis at
	Stanford University and later adapted by many authors.
