Description: This is the R implementation of Karel the robot, a programming 
  language created by Dr. R. E. Pattis at Stanford University in 1981. Karel 
  useful to teach an introductory concepts about general programming, such as 
  algorithmic decomposition, conditional statements, lopps, in an interactive 
  and fun way, writing programs to make Karel achieve certaing tasks in the 
  world she lives in. Originally based on Pascal, Karel was implemented in many 
  languages through these decades, including Java C++, Ruby and Python. This is 
  the first package implementing Karin in R.
